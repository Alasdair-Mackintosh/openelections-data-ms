Converted CSVs of Mississippi election results.

### The Process

Mississippi stores election results in PDF files at [the Secretary of State's site](http://www.sos.ms.gov/elections4.aspx). The files are stored by year, and then either by race (for special elections) or by county (for primary and general elections). The county files contain precinct-level results, organized by office, with precincts labeled vertically across the top:
